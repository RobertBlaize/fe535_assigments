# Repeat the above tasks using monthly log-returns and report the VaR(0.05).

# How do the results from tasks 5 and 6 compare? Should it matter whether it is 
# daily or monthly (recall Lab 1)? Elaborate. 

# Finally, suppose that you work with the monthly data. Let us consider some 
# sensitivity analysis and address the following questions:

# How much does the one-year VaR(0.05) increase if the annual volatility 
# increases by 5%? 

# Is the relationship between one-year VaR(0.05) and the annual volatility 
# linear? Elaborate.
